Beating the Price Heat: Finding the Perfect Climatic Region for Affordable Tomato Cultivation in Summer Months
Tomatoes are an essential crop in India, widely used in various culinary preparations. However, the prices of tomatoes often soar during the summer months due to a lack of supply. To address this issue, a study was conducted to identify districts in India that are ideal for tomato cultivation from April to July based on climate and soil conditions. This blog explores the significance of tomato cultivation, the challenges faced, and the opportunities for farmers to cultivate tomatoes in these regions.
The Tomato Price Conundrum: Despite India’s annual production of approximately 200,000 metric tonnes of tomatoes, there are periods when tomato prices skyrocket. Historical data reveals that prices particularly surge in June and July. In June 2022, retail prices reached up to Rs 100 per kilogram, causing financial strain for consumers and posing inflation challenges for the government.
Monthly prices of Tomato in the countryFactors Affecting Tomato Prices: The major contributors to the price hikes are climatic variations, including high temperatures in May and June, as well as heavy rainfall. These factors affect tomato yields and disrupt the supply chain, resulting in an inadequate tomato supply during the summer months.
Identifying Optimal Cultivation Regions: To mitigate these challenges, a comprehensive study was conducted to identify districts suitable for tomato cultivation from April to June, ensuring a steady supply and price control. Ten districts were identified based on their favorable climate, including temperature, humidity, and rainfall, along with suitable soil conditions. These districts are Ahmadnagar and Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Amreli and Panch Mahals in Gujarat, Bhojpur in Bihar, Chandauli in Uttar Pradesh, Firozpur and Hoshiarpur in Punjab, Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, and Jharsuguda in Odisha.
The Ideal Climate and Soil Conditions: Tomato plants thrive in temperatures ranging from 21 to 24°C, while temperatures above 32°C negatively impact fruit development. Frost and high humidity are also detrimental to tomato plants. Additionally, tomatoes require low to medium rainfall for optimal growth. The selected districts have an average temperature range of 27 to 33°C during the critical growth period and exhibit low to medium rainfall. The humidity ranges from 35% to 65% in these districts.
Benefits and Challenges: Choosing these districts for tomato cultivation during the summer season offers several advantages. It helps stabilize tomato prices, benefiting consumers, while also providing profitable opportunities for farmers. Increased demand during the summer months ensures better prices for tomatoes, potentially improving farmers’ income. Additionally, tomato cultivation in these districts creates employment opportunities in post-harvest operations and the agricultural supply chain. Furthermore, it contributes to enhanced food security in these regions.
However, there are challenges associated with developing these regions for tomato cultivation. Infrastructure development for post-harvest handling and logistics is crucial. Government support and policies, including subsidies for technologies such as drip irrigation and mulching, are necessary to encourage farmers in these areas.
Conclusion: Tomato cultivation plays a vital role in India’s agricultural landscape and economy. Identifying specific districts for tomato cultivation from April to July helps ensure a stable supply and controls price fluctuations. It is imperative for the government to provide incentives to farmers in these districts to enhance tomato production and promote cultivation across the country. Similar studies can be conducted for other crops, providing valuable recommendations to stakeholders in the agricultural sector.

The Benefits of Precise Irrigation for Orchard Farmers | FylloFyllo LogoAboutProductsUse CasesFarmers TalkContactBlogBook DemoThe Benefits of Precise Irrigation for Orchard Farmers
Precise Irrigation in Orchards: Why It’s Important
Orchards are a type of agricultural land that is planted with fruit trees. These trees need a lot of water to grow and produce fruit. In the past, farmers would irrigate their orchards by flooding the entire field with water. This method was inefficient and wasteful, as much of the water would evaporate or run off before it could be absorbed by the trees.
Precise irrigation is a more efficient and effective way to water orchards. It involves using sensors to measure the amount of water that is needed by each tree. The water is then delivered directly to the trees, minimizing evaporation and runoff.
There are many benefits to using precise irrigation in orchards. These benefits include:


Increased crop yields: Precise irrigation can help to increase crop yields by up to 20%. This is because the trees are able to get the water they need when they need it, which helps them to grow and produce fruit more effectively.

Reduced water use: Precise irrigation can help to reduce water use by up to 50%. This is because less water is wasted on evaporation and runoff.

Improved soil quality: Precise irrigation can help to improve soil quality by reducing the amount of salt that builds up in the soil. This is because the water is delivered directly to the trees, so it does not have a chance to evaporate and leave behind salt.

Reduced pest and disease problems: Precise irrigation can help to reduce pest and disease problems by keeping the trees healthy. This is because the trees are able to get the water they need when they need it, which helps them to resist pests and diseases.

Overall, precise irrigation is a valuable tool for orchard farmers. It can help to increase crop yields, reduce water use, improve soil quality, and reduce pest and disease problems. If you are an orchard farmer, I encourage you to consider using precise irrigation in your orchard.

The Future of Farming: How Fyllo is Paving the Way for Sustainable Agriculture | FylloFyllo LogoAboutProductsUse CasesFarmers TalkContactBlogBook DemoThe Future of Farming: How Fyllo is Paving the Way for Sustainable Agriculture
From real-time insights to crop-specific advice, see how Fyllo’s innovative approach is helping farmers increase productivity while reducing their impact on the environment.
Farming has always been a challenging profession. Farmers face a lot of difficulties in managing their crops, from irrigation to fertilization, pest control to disease prevention, and much more. However, technology has brought about a shift in the way farming is done. Fyllo is one such company that has revolutionized the farming industry through its innovative approach.
Fyllo helps farmers take precise decisions and increase farm productivity. We install devices on farms that provide farmers with access to real-time farm data, insights, and analytics through our mobile app. The Weather Pro unit captures various parameters from soil : soil moisture of two levels and soil temperature, from canopy : leaf wetness, light intensity, air temperature, air humidity, air pressure and from the environment : wind speed, wind direction and rainfall.
All the captured data is sent to Fyllo’s cloud server for analysis and processed using machine learning and AI agronomy models. From this data, we generate crop-specific advice to the farmers, such as how much to irrigate, when to irrigate, precise fertilizer schedule and spraying schedules, disease and pest predictions, weather predictions, Delta T, and climate-based suggestions like fruit cracking, fruit dropping, less flowering, harvest management, quality prediction, and yield predictions.
Fyllo’s Nero unit provides data from two levels of soil moisture and soil temperature, helping in precise irrigation and fertigation for crops. To get a crop-specific fertigation schedule, farmers need to upload a petiole test or soil report in the Fyllo app. All the recorded data is saved on our server, year by year, so farmers can access the data whenever required.
Fyllo is helping farmers to get A-grade quality produce with a 20% increase in yield, 90% export quality produce, and a 25% decrease in resources used. We are also providing 24/7 customer support for farmers with our world-class agronomy team.
Fyllo’s approach is changing the game for farmers. We are making farming more efficient, productive, and sustainable. With our innovative solutions, farmers can make precise decisions based on real-time data, leading to better crop yields and higher quality produce. Fyllo is a game-changer for farmers, and our technology is paving the way for the future of farming.

Resource Conservation : Precision agriculture helps farmers conserve natural resources such as water, soil, and nutrients. With the use of technology, farmers can precisely apply inputs such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides based on real-time data obtained from the farm. This eliminates the risk of overuse or underuse of resources, which can lead to crop losses, environmental pollution, and economic losses.

Increased Efficiency : Precision agriculture can help farmers maximize their yields and profits while minimizing inputs such as labor, time, and costs. By using precision equipment and software, farmers can accurately map their fields, detect crop variability, and optimize plant growth. This leads to increased efficiency, productivity, and profitability in farming operations.

Reduced Environmental Impact : Traditional farming methods have been known to have a significant impact on the environment, from the use of fertilizers and pesticides to soil erosion and water pollution. Precision agriculture reduces the environmental impact of farming by minimizing the use of inputs, reducing waste, and protecting soil and water quality.

Better Crop Management : Precision agriculture allows farmers to monitor their crops closely, detect early signs of disease or pest infestations, and take appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate crop losses. This leads to better crop management, reduced losses, and increased yields.

Improved Quality and Traceability : Precision agriculture enables farmers to produce high-quality crops that meet the needs of consumers and comply with food safety regulations. With the use of tracking and tracing technologies, farmers can trace their produce from the farm to the market, providing consumers with the assurance that their food is safe and sustainable.

In conclusion, precision agriculture is important in today’s farming as it offers numerous benefits such as resource conservation, increased efficiency, reduced environmental impact, better crop management, and improved quality and traceability. As the world’s population continues to grow, the demand for food will increase, and precision agriculture will play a critical role in meeting this demand sustainably and profitably.
